### Fuddle: A functional lightweight programming language for the development of modern web applications.

The Fuddle language is a fork of the [Elm language](https://elm-lang.org/) that targets the development of modern web applications. It is part of the FUDD (https://whatsupfudd.com) ecosystem.

This fork also includes the great work of [Brian Carroll](https://github.com/brian-carroll/elm-compiler) who did a first fork of the base Elm compiler to generate C and WebAssembly code rather than Javascript.
